# testapp

This is a testapplication I am using to teach myself Clojure. It basically will get information on weather api (wunderground.com) and show status for three different cities. The code is probably horrible, but I am learning. 

## Installation

Clone this repo and run 
   
    $lein uberjar 

You need to have your own apikey which you can get from wunderground.com

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    $ java -jar testapp-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

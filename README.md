# testapp

This is a testapplication I am using to teach myself Clojure. It basically will get information on weather api (wunderground.com) and show status for three different cities. The code is probably horrible, but I am learning. 

## Installation

Clone this repo and run 
   
    $lein uberjar 

This will give you a .jar file that you can run. You can give  your own apikey as a commandline argument. You can get your own apikey registering to wunderground.com

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    $ java -jar testapp-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]



## License

Do what ever you like with this.
